Universal Definition Of Love

I'm Just Trying To UnderStand How To Define One Unite Form Of Love,
Because Love Is A Universal Language.

Update And Intergrate My Idea:
Every Love Requires Physical Prove As Human Love Requires Human Touch.
Examples : Sharing Person Presence,Hugging,Kissing,Sex.
WithOut This Factor Of Prove Then The Love Will DisAppear.

The Truth About The Story : Adam And Eve
The Story Is Invented By SomeOne Who Was Thinking About Of What Would It Be Like In Heaven And Why We Have To Die.

The Inventor Thinking Makes Good Example Of Man And Woman In The RelationShip As One Can Not Exists WithOut The Second.
It Supports The Idea Of Healthy RelationShip.

Only Man And Woman Is Compatible To Have Sex.
Sexual Satisfaction Has Impact On Mentality And It Supports The Physical Prove To Support The Emotional State Of Love
OtherWise Love Will Be Silented And Then The Person Will Look For Love SomeWhere Else Which Also Includes The Prove.

So Even If Same Sex RelationShip Is Allowed By Law Due To Idea Of EveryOne Needing Love,
We Can Not Over Look The Truth Of Compatibility.
For Example : Penis Does Not Belong to Bum For Sexual Pleasure As The Bum Does Not Include This Function To Satisfy Both Lovers.
So InStead Penis Belongs To Vagina For Sexual Pleasure And Satisfy Both Lovers.

Also We Have To Take InTo Account That We Can Not Have Sex With Children And This Is Not Because Of Their Age,
But Because Of Their Compatibility As They Are Too Small And They Do Not Have The Ability Of Sexual Pleasure.
