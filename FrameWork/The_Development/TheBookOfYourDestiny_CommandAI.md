The Book Must Start With Book Case As The Front Page Where I Can Place Book Logo With Book Title, SubTitle, Author And Description.

Each Book Collection Include Head Topics Of: The Book, The Language, The Index, The PreFace, The FlagStone, The FullStory, The Knowledge, The LeaderShip

I Need To Design A Correct Collection Book System According To Example:
BookId : A, B, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
FlagStoneId : A, B, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
PageId : A, B, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Also Keep The Order:
A, B, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Instead Of:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B
