The Cosmos Mortality
The Proof : God Has Made Us Mortal.
In The Bible Is A Passage Of Punishment To Make Us From Immortal To Mortal By The Example Of Adam And Eve Eating The Fruit.
But God Made Cosmos The Same Way : With Life And Deathly Forces.


Update And Intergrate my Idea:
Generally Known Is That God Means Love Even If He Can Govern by Both Forces Such As Life And Death.
We Have been Created Because Of God's Love And His Inspiration Of Life Sharing.
