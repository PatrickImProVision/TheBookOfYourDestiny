The Law and Moral Error:
No One has The Right to take your Life even if the bible say Tooth for Tooth and Life For Life.
So According to this : Not even God has the Rights to take your life no matter how much wrong you done.
If anyone agree to kill human even by Law then it is the same thing as if anyone would kill without Law as Kill is nothing else then murder.
If the murder has commited murder and someone kills the murder then he is also murder.
If my Parent has no right to také my life then God is our Father and also has no right to take life of anyone.
According to the bible God gave us The Law and he must obey our rights otherwise it makes no sence to listen to the law if God does not listen as he is the Example for All of Us.
Even Czech Republic,EU and Other States has Removed The law that permits killing. Due to Innocence etc.

Update and Intergrate my Idea: Any harm etc. Can not be Disabled at one place and Enabled on another end as it goes to Legal Cross Dilema.

Update and Intergrate my idea: If anyone have done wrong the punishment is to prevent the person repeat the wrong again by giving him Behaviour correction and reintergrating.
If the person commits very serious crime then there is no meaning to make reintergration and for that reason the person must be isolited.
